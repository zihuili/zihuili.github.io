                    <p>Highland Animal Rescue has been open for over 50 years now and we have rescued over 2,000 animals from 4 different continents! Our founders created the facility in 1968 with only 10 members and 1 acre of land. Today, we have excellent staff who dedicate their time and effort everyday to take care of these animals. We have over 50 staff members who work 5-6 days a week to ensure that the animals are healthy and happy. We also have 4 acres of land that our facility is spread out upon.</p>
                    <p>Every species is incredibly important to the ecosystem. Whether the animal is a carnivore, herbivore, omnivore, producer, or consumer, it is equally significant to the food chain and ecosystem. Although not all species are Key Stone species, all species hold the key to survival for other species. Thankfully, our community is well educated in the importance of keeping animals from extinction because we have raised over $10,000 in 2017 alone to enhance our facility! Over the past 50 years we have raised approximately $500,000, which is incredible for such a humble start. </p>
                    <p>Our facility has 3 hospitals and 30 vetenarians to treat our animals. Each of our stalls or enclosures has enough room for 4-5 animals to roam about freely without conflict. We ensure that each animal can stay active despite being at our facility, which is small in scale in comparison to the wild. We feed our animals only fresh and nutritious meals and we make sure to document them every 2-3 days to see their progress, especially if they came to our facility previously injured or with illness.</p>

                        <h3>What We Do</h3>
                        <p>Our goal is simple. We want to re-establish the populations of the endangered animals. However, the course to achieve this goal is much more daunting and difficult than it sounds. We do what we can everyday to take care of these animals, study them, determine if they can be re-released into the wild, and then use our research to see what we can do to save the populations. We need more than our facility to be able to achieve this goal. The support of the entire community or even the entire world will make this goal possible. We must work together to achieve something that is impossible alone.</p>
